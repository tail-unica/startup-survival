"""
Frequency encoding of categorical features, fitted on a training split alone.

A share computed over the whole dataset would be computed partly from the very
rows it later encodes: that is the look-ahead leakage this project is about,
applied to the features instead of the target.

So the shares are estimated on the training rows only and then *looked up* for
the held-out rows, and a held-out row contributes nothing to its own encoding.

    Learns the training share of every category of one categorical column.

    Categories holding less than ``min_frequency`` of the training rows are
    pooled into a single ``other_label`` bucket, whose share is the sum of
    theirs. Missing values are part of the sample and go into the same bucket:
    they are rows the model will see, not rows to drop.

    Shares are relative (count / n_training_rows) rather than raw counts. Within
    one experiment the choice is immaterial — RobustScaler divides by the IQR
    and absorbs any constant factor — but the four experiments (window,
    nowindow, noteam, nocompetitors) have different row counts, so a raw count
    of 900 would mean a different share of the sample in each. The paper
    compares those experiments to each other, including their SHAP importances,
    so the feature has to carry the same units in all of them.
