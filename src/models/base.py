"""Common interface for the model families the sweep trains.

A family is defined by four answers:

- which matrix it is fitted on: imputed-only, or imputed and scaled;
- how it turns probabilities into labels;
- which SHAP explainer stays tractable on it;
- which rows that explainer is given.

One subclass gives all four, so the training loop never branches on the model
type and a new family is a new file plus one line in the registry.
